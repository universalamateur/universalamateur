I like explicit asks. I’m better at helping when I have a good idea of what you need. “Take a look” is less helpful than “I’m looking for feedback on X and Y, by end of month”.
I like knowing what you've already tried. Explain what you've already searched for on your own, and what assumptions have been challenged.

Communicating with me
I tend to make suggestions and asks, rather than commands.
This can make my input unclear. If I’m not communicating expectations effectively, please say so and I’ll do my best to adjust my style. If I have a strong opinion about something, I will say so.
I try to express gratitude frequently. This is genuine.

I try to be a structured communicator and thinker, but sometimes start to speak in an unstructured way when I get excited about something, when I'm on the go, or when I'm crunched for time.

Please interject if you’re not getting what you want out of me.
Brevity does not equate to being rude, short, or perturbed.
Please do not take offense to periods of silence. I prefer long, uninterrupted windows of time for deep work. I disable all notifications on my Mac and everything but iMessage on my phone. This allows me to focus deeply on one task at a time, which is a more efficient way of working than attempting to multitask. In return, I will devote my full attention to your request and respond thoughtfully, with context and passion.
Unless specifically mentioned, I don’t expect immediate responses from anyone. I respect others’ time and want you to have the space for a thoughtful response.


# 3 things system and Getting things Done

The goal is to achieve 3 meaningful outcomes every day, week, month, and year. Small outcomes add up to meaningful and long-term results
Productivity is about doing the right things at the right time. Choosing 3 tasks forces prioritization and helps avoid context switching
Key benefits of this system include:
reduction in time spent on unimportant work
improved personal efficiency and effectiveness
increased sense of accomplishment
increased results over time
Choose a recording system that works for you: notepad, sticky notes, Mac reminders, GitLab issues, etc.
Each day, choose what needs to get done today and decide what can be punted to future days/months
Other things will come up outside of your 3 tasks. When they do, write them down on a next or future card. Write them down so you can take remove the pressure of having to remember these tasks.
Adapt this system to meet your own needs
